		<h2>What?</h2>
		<p>A hidden garden sounds like a fascinating place. And Wendy's is precisely that. A secret public sanctuary in
			the middle of Sydney, more like the city’s one of many hidden jewels. 
			It's only a short walk from Milsons Point and North Sydney train stations and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It
			is tucked away behind Luna Park in Lavender Bay. 
			There are high slopes and a variety of steps, yet it is free and accessible every day.</p>

		<h2>The Story</h2>
		<p>In 1970, Wendy and her late husband, the celebrated artist <a href="#">Brett Whiteley</a>, established their
			family home in Lavender Bay and <a href="#">resided there for 20 years</a>.
			In the weeks following Brett's passing in 1992, Wendy threw herself into the desolate area just at the base
			of her residence, cleaning everything she found there. 
			As she cleaned the area, Wendy started constructing a garden that looked like a huge painting. Wendy's
			gardening is not influenced by horticulture but is motivated by beauty, hue, design, elegance, and
			playfulness. </p>

		<blockquote>Wendy says, "When I first began the garden, I knew nothing about gardening. I simply knew what I
			enjoyed. I've since discovered what it's like to be here. The plants, myself, and my gardeners all depend on
			one another.”</blockquote>
		<h2>Did you know?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Wendy never asked any authority for permission to build the garden, nor did anyone forbid her.</li>
			<li>Many of Brett's famous paintings of Sydney Harbour were created in this home.</li>
		</ul>
