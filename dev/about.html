			<h2>The Story in Sam’s words</h2>
			<p>I had recently arrived in the country from the UK to live in Australia. To get a feel for the place I was
				about to call home for the next few years, I decided to do a walking tour of the city. I went along
				eager to learn and discover more about this amazing place. The tour began well with some interesting
				facts. It soon, however, became uninspiring after listening to the tour guide talking for what seemed
				like forever. We had hardly moved from the same spot!</p>
			<p>Eventually, I left the tour feeling like I still needed to explore the city further and uncover all its
				gems in a quicker and more efficient way. This is what led to the creation of Adventure Clues. It was
				the catalyst to start something unique and with the vision to help others to never be uninspired again
				when exploring a city. But how could it be done?I have always been interested in creative thinking and
				have always liked crosswords in my spare time. That’s when I had the ‘lightbulb moment’. What about
				creating a <a href="#">trail</a> of cryptic clues around the city to uncover the best parts? The parts
				that even the locals don’t know about.</p>
			<p>Working with a small but talented team of tech developers we managed to create a clever web application
				that is fun and easy to use. Fast forward to today and we also have a small happy team of clue setters
				whose job it is to go out in the city and find the coolest spots and hidden secrets just waiting for you
				to uncover’. Who would have thought that first initial city tour would actually turn into something
				rather successful?</p>
			<p>*Update – With Covid-19 changing the world, our tours have continued to thrive. And our latest initiative
				involves helping travel businesses back on their feet by enabling them to use our software. We are
				really excited about this venture. See <a href="#">here</a> for more info.</p>

					<p>Believe us, going about the city, exploring hidden places and solving clues is fun. In fact it’s

					<p>We believe that the best way to learn is to have fun doing so. Cryptic Clues are fun, and are
						even more fun when they lead you to new and exciting places. Gamification of learning
						experiences is really on trend at the moment. Think about it, Adventure Clues is a lot more fun
						than just reading a map.</p>
